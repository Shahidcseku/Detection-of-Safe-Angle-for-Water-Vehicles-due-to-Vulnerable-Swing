#  Detection of Safe Angle for Water Vehicles due to Vulnerable Swing

 This is a method to determine the safe angle for water vehicles in order to remain safe during the vulnerable swing caused by the natural disaster.\
 This method is computationally efficient and is suitable for on-board real-time implementation as well as autonomous marine robotic vehicles.\
 The method works based on the hypothesis Tilt ∝ Vsinθ. \
 The goal is to find the optimum position of a waterways vehicle in which state the vehicle is the most stable in terms of wind, vulnerable swing, and whirlpool which may cause the vehicle sank into water or displace its heading.
